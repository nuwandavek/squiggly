# squigglylines


Create xkcd like squiggly-lined plots using matplotlib. I know, I know, matplotlib has actually upstream-ed it, it already exists. But it sucks. I need my xkcd like plots looking perfect!


## Installation

- Clone this repo
- Make sure the [xkcd](https://github.com/ipython/xkcd-font/blob/master/xkcd-script/font/xkcd-script.ttf) font is installed on your system
- You have to rename the file from `xkcd-script.ttf` -> `xkcd_script.ttf` in `~/.local/share/fonts`.
- And also delete `~/.cache/matplotlib`, and restart your jupyter notebook of course.
